## üìö About the Project

**EDUMATE** is an Android application designed to assist students in solving exercises by integrating advanced
**Artificial Intelligence (A.I)** capabilities. Whether you're stuck on a tough math problem or need help understanding
a complex concept, EDUMATE is your intelligent study companion.

This application is built following the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture combined with clean code principles
in software engineering such as **SOLID**, **DRY**, and **KISS**, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and readability of the codebase.

This application is the part of a larger system developed using a **Client-Server architecture**. In this setup, the Android application
a[]()cts as the **client**, responsible for handling user interactions, managing UI logic, and communicating with a backend server
via RESTful APIs. The server handles data processing, A.I. operations, and user authentication.


### üß© System Overview

EDUMATE System is structured based on a **Client-Server Architecture**:

- üñ•Ô∏è **Backend**: Built with **Spring Boot**, responsible for handling business logic, authentication,
  A.I. processing, and data management. It exposes RESTful APIs for communication.
- üì± **Android Client**: Acts as the user-facing application. It interacts with the backend to send
  user input and display processed results.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è This README focuses solely on the Android client-side implementation of the EDUMATE system.
> Check [EDUMATE - Backend Server](https://github.com/Hg3L/UCP_EDUMATE-Backend-Server) for more information about
> our server-side
